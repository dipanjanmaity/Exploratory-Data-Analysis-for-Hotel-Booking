# :hotel: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Hotel Booking Dataset using Python

In this project I have analysed a Hotel Booking Dataset. This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and babies, and the number of available parking spaces and many things.

<br>

The major goal of this project is to investigate and analyze data in order to identify significant elements that influence reservations and provide knowledge to hotel management so that it may implement various campaigns to increase sales and performance.
